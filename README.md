This is a simple Java console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player will receive feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number.
Instructions:

    1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
    2. Open the project in your Java development environment.

How to Play:

    Upon running the program, the player will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 100 to make their guess.
    After each guess, the program will provide feedback to the player, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
    The player will continue guessing until they guess the correct number.
    Once the correct number is guessed, the program will display a message indicating that the player has guessed correctly.
    After each game, the player will have the option to start a new game or exit the program.
        To start a new game, enter "Y" or "y" followed by pressing "ENTER".
        To exit the program, enter "N" or "n" followed by pressing "ENTER".
